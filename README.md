<b>This project is currently under development :)</b><br/><br/>ptjs is an open-source wrapper of the PyTorch library, allowing developers to run PyTorch models in a Node.js environment.

## Examples
Our collection of [examples](./examples) is currently under development.

## Development
 * ```yarn install``` should allow you to install project dependancies
 * ```yarn test``` to run the test suite for this project

## Misc
* This project uses [arition's fork of torch-js](https://github.com/arition/torch-js) to run TorchScript modules - check the project out if you're curious about how we do it!
* Distributed under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for more information.
* The original proposal for this project may be found [here](./docs/Proposal.md)
